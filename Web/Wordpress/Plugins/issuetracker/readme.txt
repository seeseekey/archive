Adds a full issue tracking system to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

IssueTracker is a bug tracking system for WordPress.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

To insert the tracker, create a new post (preferably a page) and insert the following content in the body:

<!--issuetracker-1-->

And publish! Thats it! You could now access your tracker via accessing the page you just created. The UI could easily be styled via the style file included.

For best appearance, use a single-column page template for the tracker (no sidebar) and disable comments and pingbacks. but it will work either way.

Settings for the plugin could be found under Settings >> Issue Tracker
