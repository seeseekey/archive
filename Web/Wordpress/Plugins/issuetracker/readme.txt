Adds a full issue tracking system to your WordPress blog.

== Description ==

WP-IssueTracker is a full (yet basic) issue tracking system to plug right in your WordPress powered site! Operating an issue tracking system has never been this easy!

Currently WP-IT can operate one tracker per blog. However the back-end was designed to allow as many trackers as you might want. This will be targeted in a later release.

== Installation ==

Extract the zip file and just drop the contents in the wp-content/plugins/ directory of your WordPress installation and then activate the Plugin from Plugins page.

To insert the tracker, create a new post (preferably a page) and insert the following content in the body:

<!--wp-issuetracker-1-->

And publish! Thats it! You could now access your tracker via accessing the page you just created. The UI could easily be styled via the style file included.

For best appearance, use a single-column page template for the tracker (no sidebar) and disable comments and pingbacks. but it will work either way.

Settings for the plugin could be found under Settings >> Issue Tracker
